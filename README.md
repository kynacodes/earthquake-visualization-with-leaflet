# earthquake-visualization-with-leaflet

Usage: 
-------------------
Using Leaflet, I completed visualizations of earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey 
(USGS). Their website's JSON data (which they update every 5 minutes) is used to map earthquakes. Their 
magnitudes are reflected through their size and color (larger and darker = higher magnitude), while 
popups which provide additional information when you click on a marker.
